title: Smooth the Learning Curve

If we want many more people to be fluent working with data, we do need to make it easier for folks to get started.  But creating easy-as-a-microwave experiences for beginners is just the first step.  

To truly democratize data, we need to radically improve the Learnability and UX of the tools and mental models we use for each step along the continuum from beginners to power users to analytics engineers and data scientists.

Some parts of smoothing the learning curve can only be addressed by the people who build the tools we use.  But there are plenty of steps that many organizations and/or communities across organizations can take.  For example, an organization might create a simple, lightweight library on top of pandas that makes it much easier to use pandas to address a few specific user or department needs, plus some template Jupyter notebooks and cheat sheets that target those needs.
