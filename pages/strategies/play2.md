For most people, using data feels intimidating and boring -- and working with data is often taught in a way that reinforces these feelings. 

What if we were to make working with data more like play? 

Why is making working with data and expressing data more creatively & playfully important?
 1. To reach more people (Audrey Lord)
 - helping people not feel stupid, imposter, etc.
 - To help people more fully engage, with the way they do with the game/toy

2. Help people build grassroots power:
 - For people to fully use the power they have, they need to know how to play on this battlefield, how to play the game, which is increasingly data-centric (what if planning felt more like playing a fun game?)
 - As a small means of exercising power over how you are defined:  from using data to dehumanize people and grind them down to turning data into a site for expressing our full creative selves, both individually and together
 - Helping people become more comfortable / explore making hard trade-offs that are essential to true democracy (if it’s always “the Democrats” and not taking any responsibility for electing more senators or building power at the state level, then we are stripping ourselves of a lot of the power we have

{ okay, what might this look like?
- Creative DataViz
- Dashboards As Game Boards
