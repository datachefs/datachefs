For most people, using data feels intimidating and boring -- and working with data is often taught in a way that reinforces these feelings. 

What if we were to make working with data more like play? 

In the short term, our goal is to:
- Make it easier for newcomers to get their feet wet and to overcome any feelings of intimidation, imposter syndrome, etc.
- Help people more fully engage with data the way they do with a game or a toy

In the long-term, we believe making working data more like play could provide a small but important role in helping communities build effective grassroots power:
- __Exercise Power over How We Are Defined__:  as a way of dehumanizing people, making it easier to treat them like widgets. We believe the tactical use of making working with data more playful could be used as a way for expressing our full creative selves, both individually and together, opening up small but important spaces for redefining how data is used
- From City Hall to the statehouse to work sites, as hard as it is to use grassroots power to win, it can be even harder to understand what they can do once they've won. Data is often deployed in a way to make battles over budgets, etc. opaque and intimidating, something that only experts can understand. By making working with data more playful, we think we may be able to open up more room to take power away from budget geeks and to put people's values at the center of conversations
- __Getting Comfortable Making Complex Trade-Offs__: it's one thing to denounce people with power when you don't have any. But when grassroots groups start winning elections, they often face hard, complex trade-offs that most folks are used to having to make. As a way to intimidate or obfuscate so people don't understand the choices they have. But by making working with data more like a game, for example, it's it can make it easier for people to {tap into the parts of them that I used to making difficult trade-offs in games??}
