title: Use a Community-Oriented Inclusive Approach

When organizations train and support their users, they usually focus on individuals. But organizations aren't just composed of individuals. Humans are social creatures who are often part of rich, complex networks. 

Data Chefs argues that we should take advantage of that by leveraging the power of community:

 - __Within Organizations__: growing an organization's internal ecosystem that helps different types of users flourish and support each other, using an iterative approach that racks up small, strategic wins while building towards larger victories
 - __Across Organizations__: creating an ecosystem across organizations so they can share knowledge, pool resources, and collectively learn to smooth the learning curve
 - __Across Societies__: expanding this ecosystem so it connects large organizations to the community so communities from Harlem to Harlan County can benefit

As we do so, we should learn from previous efforts to [use grassroots-based approaches to democratize knowledge](https://toolkit.makersall.org/pages/50-support/10-community-support.html#create-multiple-on-ramps). For example:
- [Extension Services](https://toolkit.makersall.org/pages/10-intro/30-extension-citizenship-schools.html), which powered the agricultural revolution by democratizing agricultural knowledge — and whose failures as well as successes have a lot of teach us
- The 1960s Civil Rights Movement’s [Citizenship Schools](https://toolkit.makersall.org/pages/70-civic/20-citizenship-schools.html), which not only trained staggering numbers of African Americans in the South how to read and right but also trained more than 10,000 community leaders who were critical to the Movement’s success

These community-based approaches often drew from several strategies that can help inform our approach:

- __Identify and Develop Natural Leaders__. Extension agents often focused on identifying and developing natural leaders: farmers who were already widely respected in their community. These natural leaders had preexisting social networks and relationships they could use to recruit other famers. And they were also likely to understand the concerns and fears that agents needed to address if farmers were to be convinced to adopt new techniques.  
  - When recruiting a school’s teachers, they targeted people who civil rights activist Dorothy Cotton described as “people with Ph.D. minds who never had the chance to get an education who were the natural leaders in their communities”

- __Multiple Paths to Learning Grounded in Where People Are__

  - Nurtured Neighborhood Clubs. Extension agents helped farming communities form neighborhood clubs and worked with clubs to ensure farmers got a steady stream of ideas about how they could improve their farming. As a result, farmers weren’t just hearing about an idea brought in by an outsider, they were learning while surrounded by their peers who spoke the same language and understood the realities they faced.
  - Produced Informal Learning Materials. To supply these clubs, extension agents provided lots and lots of pamphlets and other written materials that were crafted to help teach farmers new techniques and address any concerns they had. Many extension agents also were heavy users of radio broadcasts and other new forms of communication.
  - Fostered Community Events. Extension agents helped foster state fairs and other places where farmers could see demonstrations, compete to see who could use new techniques to grow the best crops, etc.

- __Create Multiple On-Ramps__.  For someone living in a community our society has written off, the idea of getting started in coding can be daunting. The obstacles they face can feel overwhelming. And if classes will put a big strain on your life because of the cost and time they require, how do you know it’s worth the sacrifice? At this point, you don’t even know if you like coding enough to want to do it for a living. That’s why we need to create multiple on ramps. We need to go where people are, where they are surrounded by their peers, and create opportunities for them to get their feet wet. Where it makes sense to create on ramps will depend on the community. For example:
  - Barbershops and beauty salons
  - Union halls
  - Churches and other houses of worship, who could offer a short program before or after one of their weekly sermons so members could try a little coding and talk to people who are already doing it
Wherever people congregate, wherever they are surrounded by people they know and trust, we should explore ways of breaking down barriers and firing up interest.

- __Create Peer-To-Peer Support and other forms of community-based learning in order to overcome insecurity, psychological barriers__ – e.g., seeing oneself as someone who works with their hands – and uncertainty. This kind of community-based approach also has the potential to knock down obstacles that many are afraid we can’t overcome. For example, some have argued that many people – especially men – who work in blue collar jobs won’t want to become coders because their sense of identity is tied to working with their hands. That’s a huge problem for an outsider who’s trying to convince them. But if someone who’s resistant is being recruited by a natural leader they trust, and if they know they’ll be making this transition surrounded by their peers who’ve also spent a lifetime working with their hands, this is a much easier nut to crack.

## Foster Diversity

Data science, data engineering, analytics, etc. aren't very diverse. If your organization is committed to diversity and inclusion, how do you ensure you don't replicate this problem?  The key: don't make diversity an afterthought. As you are trying to grow an ecosystem of power users, design in diversity from the ground up.
