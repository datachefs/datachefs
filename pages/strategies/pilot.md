Back before everything was digital, community organizers routinely drew pictures — or in some cases, [toys and chocolate](/pages/examples/worrking-america/playful.html)   — to turn data into stories. Now that all the data is electronic, it’s much less common. And when people do it, it tends to be expensive and a one-off.
 
But in the past few years, two changes have opened up some interesting opportunities:
- New free tech -- e.g., open source JavaScript libraries such as p5.js and BablyonJS -- that can produce amazing graphics, and based on my experience working with non-techies at ASHA and in the community, I'm confident the tech could be modified so that an adventurous beginner could easily use it
- New global networks of liberal and progressive artists and graphic designers who are fired up about working with the community. 
 
As a result, we believe we are at the point where it's possible to foster a diverse community/ecosystem that could:
- Make it radically easier for grassroots organizations to produce creative DataViz that could be used for community and union organizing/bargaining as well as fundraising
- Create opportunities for progressive artists & graphic designers -- especially those from marginalized communities --  to partially support themselves with a steady stream of paid work from large nonprofits as well as eventually from corporations and governments
