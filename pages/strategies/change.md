{ Pieces of the Puzzle:

Frontal assault -- storming the beach - vs guerrilla
(8 course meal with forgiving friends)

Iterative, Politically Aware

for different audiences:
how do you diagnose where to start, where to focus?


What is the UX of the people who create the data products? Do they enjoy their work? Is it same?

- Measuring takes effort (the UX of metrics)
- Baby Steps: Get Your Feet Wet

- Test out your ideas
- Start where people are
- some will resist for good reasons -- e.g., you haven't thought it through, they don't trust the H igher Ups, some for bad reasons -- Priests, Silo Guard Dog

- Agile
- Don't create solution, create ecosystem
- Peer to peer
- Internal politics
