title: Use a Community-Oriented Inclusive Approach

When organizations train and support their users, they usually focus on individuals. But organizations aren't just composed of individuals. Humans are social creatures who are often part of rich, complex networks. 

Data Chefs argues that we should take advantage of that by leveraging the power of community:

 - __Within Organizations__: growing an organization's internal ecosystem that helps different types of users flourish and support each other, using an iterative approach that racks up small, strategic wins while building towards larger victories
 - __Across Organizations__: creating an ecosystem across organizations so they can share knowledge, pool resources, and collectively learn to smooth the learning curve
 - __Across Societies__: expanding this ecosystem so it connects large organizations to the community so the community can also benefit  and doing so, developing a model and laying the foundation to help communities from Harlem to Harlan County benefit from and have a say over the explosion of wealth that will be created by AI, augmented and virtual reality, and other forms of emerging tech over the next 20 years

As we do so, we should learn from previous efforts to [use grassroots-based approaches to democratize knowledge](https://toolkit.makersall.org/pages/50-support/10-community-support.html#create-multiple-on-ramps). For example:
- [Extension Services](https://toolkit.makersall.org/pages/10-intro/30-extension-citizenship-schools.html), which powered the agricultural revolution by democratizing agricultural knowledge — and whose failures as well as successes have a lot of teach us
- The 1960s Civil Rights Movement’s [Citizenship Schools](https://toolkit.makersall.org/pages/70-civic/20-citizenship-schools.html), which not only trained staggering numbers of African Americans in the South how to read and right but also trained more than 10,000 community leaders who were critical to the Movement’s success

## Foster Diversity

Data science, data engineering, analytics, etc. aren't very diverse. If your organization is committed to diversity and inclusion, how do you ensure you don't replicate this problem?  The key: don't make diversity an afterthought. As you are trying to grow an ecosystem of power users, design in diversity from the ground up.
