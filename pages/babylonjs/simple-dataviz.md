<p> The following are a few simple data visualization experiments. Most of them don't follow dataviz best practices, and they need work to make them prettier. The purpose of these examples is to rough out what's involved in doing a data visualization using BabylonJS.</p>

<!-- <h3>Using a User-defined Grid</h3> -->
<ul>
<li> <a href=" dataviz-simple/goals-spheres.html">Row of goals</a><br/>
{Replace the background picture, play with lighting, add ex showcasing different effects: choosing a color from a gradient, displaying a gradient, transparency, textures, PBR, etc.}</li>
<!-- <li> <a href="dataviz-simple/grid-spheres.html">Goals in a user-defined grid</a> <br/> 
{NOTE: this is just scaffolding}</li> -->
<li> <a href=" dataviz-simple/grid-spheres-labels.html">Goals in a the user-defined grid, with labels on the balls</a><br/>
{Is this worth keeping?  If so, Add title, figure out labels centering, play with lights}</li>
<!-- <li> <a href="dataviz-simple/grid-building-rooms.html">Rooms in a building</a><br/>
{Put labels on just 2 sides,Exes that try PBR, Etc.}</li> -->
</ul>
