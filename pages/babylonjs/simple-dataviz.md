<p> The following are a few simple data visualization experiment. Most of them don't follow dataviz best practices, and frankly, most of them aren't that pretty. The purpose of these examples is to rough out what's involved in doing a data visualization using BabylonJS.</p>

<h2>Using a User-defined Grid</h2>
<ul>
<li> <a href=" dataviz-simple/goals-spheres.html">Row of goals</a><br/>
{Switch to meshbuilder,Figure out labels, play with lighting, add ex showcasing different effects: choosing a color from a gradient, displaying a gradient, transparency, textures, PBR, etc.}</li>
<li> <a href="dataviz-simple/grid-spheres.html">Goals in a user-defined grid</a> <br/> 
{NOTE: this is just scaffolding}</li>
<li> <a href=" dataviz-simple/grid-spheres-labels.html">Goals in a the user-defined grid, with labels on the balls</a><br/>
{Add title, figure out labels centering, play with lights}</li>
<li> <a href="dataviz-simple/grid-building-rooms.html">Rooms in a building</a><br/>
{Put labels on just 2 sides,Exes that try PBR, Etc.}</li>
</ul>
