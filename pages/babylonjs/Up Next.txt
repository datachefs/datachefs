What is instead of trying to do everything, I radically narrowed my scope to:
- Using animate
  - with simple objects
  - with PBR
  - with fancier materials (textures?)
  - with GLTFs
- Adding labels a.k.a. text
- Adding controls

For example:

- Traffic with buses and biking versus cars?
  - FIRST: how will I calculate how much traffic?
(Carrying capacity of walking, biking, buses, etc vs cars — Brent todarian for data?  That info graphic )

- Social Mobility data
  - Use movement along a path?
  - Can you use one animation key/map for multiple objects? Does it matter?
  - Using a color gradient so you can easily track how many people ended up moving from one bracket to another, and crossing that by race/gender/etc.

And then I could try:
- Showing only certain parts of a GLFT as a way of displaying progress
  - start with "https://www.babylonjs.com/Assets/FlightHelmet/glTF/"
  - call inspector from the code
  - Try using a sandwich!

- Creating an abstract map
  - Of a few states where you have offices
