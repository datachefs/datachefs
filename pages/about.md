In Makers All’s [flagship report](https://toolkit.makersall.org), [we argue](https://toolkit.makersall.org/pages/50-support/10-community-support.html#explore-connecting-community-and-workplace-support) there’s a way for  corporations and large nonprofits to design their tech training/retraining strategy  so it also benefits marginalized communities:

> Between waves of automation and waves of new tech, corporations are going to face a never-ending need to train and retrain their staff. Currently, most simply aren’t equipped to do so.
> 
> Staff in corporations and other large organizations don’t have the same needs as people in the community. But there are many areas where they may overlap. As communities are developing a rich ecosystem for their members, it may be worth exploring if there are ways to jointly address their needs. 

Data Chefs is a pilot project to develop a framework for doing this in analytics and data science by growing organizational ecosystems of power users / "[citizen data scientists](https://toolkit.makersall.org/pages/50-support/10-community-support.html#explore-connecting-community-and-workplace-support") that are connected to a broader ecosystem.
