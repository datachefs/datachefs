title: Can Data Chefs Help USDS Revolutionize How Our Government Uses Data Science?

_NOTE: This project isn't the typical kind of project USDS takes on, but I thought it might raise some possibilities about what you might consider; even if it's not the right fit, it might inspire a project that is. It also gives you a feel for how I think through complex problems._

Over the past decade, the tools for helping staff who aren't coders transform and analyze data have gotten more and more powerful. Even in machine learning and AI, "Auto ML" is just beginning to allow power users to do some work that only a few years ago required a highly skilled data scientist.  

But in the rush to build better tools, no one's addressing a major challenge: how can large organizations unleash this powerful tech on scale without creating a hot mess?  For example, as lots of power users take on responsibility for more complex data work, if they don't take on at least a lightweight version of version control, lifecycle management, data governance, etc., we'll end up replacing a rigid, centralized monolith with a decentralized Wild West.

Based on [my research at Makers All](https://toolkit.makersall.org) and decades of field experience, I'm developing a solution called [Data Chefs](/index.html). It's a framework for:

- Growing an organization's internal ecosystem to help power users flourish, using an iterative, Agile approach that racks up small, strategic wins while building towards larger victories
- Building an ecosystem across organizations so they can share knowledge, pool resources, and collaboratively work to [smooth the learning curve](https://toolkit.makersall.org/pages/30-smooth/00-index.html) from beginner to power user to data scientist/engineer
- Using this ecosystem across organizations to connect large organizations to the community, so communities from Harlem to Harlan County can also benefit

USDS is in a unique position to exploit the potential power of Data Chefs: 

#### 1) Help Address The Federal Government's Enormous Unmet Need for Analytics & Data Science
-  Like much of the corporate world, Federal agencies can't find or afford enough data scientists to meet their needs. A Data Chefs approach could fill part of this by radically increasing the number of power users. And because the government operates on such a large-scale, USDS could also explore leveraging work by computer education researchers that has the potential to [radically reduce the learning curve](https://toolkit.makersall.org/pages/30-smooth/30-evangelize-research.html) from power user to data scientist/engineer
- Data Chefs could create opportunities to develop a more diverse federal data analytics/data science staff. For example, administrative staff tend to be more diverse, and they are great pool for recruiting power users, some of whom could eventually be trained to become data scientists and engineers.


#### 2) Spread Agile Practices

One of Data Chefs' core strategies is adapting Agile techniques to the unique needs of power users. In doing so, it could further USDS’ mission of bringing best practices and new approaches to support government modernization efforts:

- Compared to a massive, high risk software project, most of Data Chefs' work operates at a much smaller scale. So, it should be easier to convince agencies to use Data Chefs to get their feet wet with Agile practices.
- Just like 4H was used in part to sell modern agricultural practices to adults — if a child can grow 3x more corn on a tiny plot of their family's land, their parents can see that these techniques will work for the family farm — Data Chefs is a low risk way to show mid-level managers what Agile do, which might make them more comfortable trying out Agile on larger projects.

#### 3) Lay the Groundwork for Creating Emerging Tech Jobs and Businesses in Communities That Are Hurting

- One of Data Chefs' goals is to create an intermediate step  --  it's a lot less intimidating to take on training nontechies sales staff than it is to train ex-miners, and it's less intimidating to develop power users than professional programmers.
- As USDS helped iteratively, incrementally grow an overarching ecosystem across agency ecosystems, it would create a resource that could also help large corporations, small businesses, and state and local government save time and money in addressing their data science needs.  If USDS helped grow an ecosystem that spans not only across federal agencies but eventually across tech companies & large corporations as well as community groups, it could open the door to pulling off the same trick with AI and robotics more generally, AR/VR, digital fabrication, and other emerging tech that's going to produce an enormous amount of wealth over the next 20 years.
-  As a resuly, communities from Appalachia to Compton would have a shot at creating jobs and small businesses that could be a critical foundation in revitalizing their community, ushering in a new era of unprecedented prosperity.

- Makers All’s [strategy](https://toolkit.makersall.org/pages/strategies.html) calls for building [two](https://toolkit.makersall.org/pages/30-smooth/10-culture-community-coding-UX.html) [types](https://toolkit.makersall.org/pages/50-support/10-community-support.html#explore-connecting-community-and-workplace-support) of collaborations between community groups and tech & large corporations so both benefit.   From the conversations I’ve had since our flagship report was published, it’s become clear that this strategy has a chicken and egg problem:  both sides find it too intimidating to jump first, because they’re dubious the other will follow.
