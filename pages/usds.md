title: Can USDS Do for Data Science Power Users What DARPA Did for the Internet?

Over the past decade, the tools for helping staff who aren't coders transform and analyze data have gotten more and more powerful. Even in machine learning/AI, we're in the early stages of "Auto ML" that lets power users do some of the work of data scientists.  But in the rush to build better tools, no one's addressing a major challenge: how can large organizations unleash this powerful tech without creating a hot mess? 

Based on my decades of field experience and my research at Makers All, I'm developing a solution I call Data Chefs. It's a framework for growing an organization's internal ecosystem that helps power users flourish, using an iterative approach that racks up small, strategic wins while building towards larger victories. And as a number of organizations do so, they can begin to pool resources.

USDS is in a unique position to exploit the potential power of Data Chefs.  Like the rest of the corporate world, Federal agencies have a huge unmet need for more data science & can't find enough data scientists to hire.  A Data Chefs approach would totally make sense — and it would leverage the fact that the federal govt has all these different govt agency ecosystems, so there’s a lot of room to get a big ROI.  

A USDS Data Chefs initiative could have several other useful effects:

__Spread Agile Practices__
One of the core parts of Data Chefs is adapting Agile techniques to the needs of power users. In doing so, it could further USDS’ main mission by spreading Agile practices in a way that’s much easier to do.  

- With Data Chefs, you’re helping handfuls of power users at a time, not trying to turn around a gianormous $$$$ govt software project.  
- And just like 4H was in part used to sell modern agricultural practices to adults — if Timmy can grow 3x more on a tiny plot on your land, you can see with your own eyes that the techniques will work for your farm — Data Chefs would show what Agile do in  low risk way, which might open the eyes of mid level manager to trying out Agile in bigger projects.

__Leverage Work by Feds and Others__
- Eventually, it could leverage a lot of work already being done by the Feds, such as the Pentagon’s X Data project (eg, open source tools for data viz for huge amts of data), the Pentagon’s support for community digital fabrication maker centers, etc
- It could also leverage work by computer education researchers. Because the government operates on such a large scale,

__Boost Data Science in Business Community and Local Government__

__Lay the Groundwork for Creating Jobs and Businesses from Harlem to Harlan County__
Makers All’s strategy calls for building collaborations between tech companies and community groups in Appalachia & elsewhere so that both benefit.   From the conversations I’ve had since my report came out, it’s become clear that I’ve got a chicken and egg problem:  both sides find it too intimidating to jump first, cause they’re dubious that the other will follow. One of the driving forces behind Data Chefs is to to get the most innovative parts of the govt plus their most innovative, agile business partners to jump, then getting tech companies and community  groups to follow should be much, much easier.
