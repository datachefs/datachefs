{NOTE: DRAFT}

Data Chefs is a work in progress. Here's what we've done so far and where we are heading next.

## Experiments at ASHA (v0.1)

Before I took a sabbatical to create [Makers All]( https://makersall.org/), I was the manager of the Decision Support Services team at the [American Speech-Language-Hearing Association](https://www.asha.org/) (ASHA).

{ Briefly describe the problems we ran into and what we did to try to solve them. Link to [first Data Chefs blog]( https://dchefs.wordpress.com/).

<!-- Managed a program to develop:
A metadata-driven ETL process designed to create a single source of truth, accommodating data models that spanned 10,000 tables
A web-based list cutting tool that transformed 86% of existing user requests into self-service, allowing novice users to easily use complex business logic to cut 800 email and postal lists a year
A data warehouse providing self-service BI using Excel and PowerBI
A self-service architecture empowering data scientists and power users so they can access and analyze complex data using SQL, SPSS, pandas

As part of a program I co-led to transform ASHA into a data-driven organization, created and managed an initiative to make ASHA into a data visualization-literate organization. It consisted of 2 projects: 
Data Visualization Ambassadors ("Divas"), an enterprise-wide network of users who were trained and supported in advocating for the effective use of data viz in their unit
The Shiny Object Task Force, which explored the strategic, creative use of new data viz technology such as D3.js and VR/AR. In doing so, it also:
Saved ASHA from spending money on countless flashy but ineffective vendor-driven projects 
Acted as a staff retention strategy, giving mission-critical domain experts throughout the enterprise an opportunity to be creative and develop their skills -->

## New Principles, Strategy (v0.2)

{ briefly explain how ended up coming up with new iteration of
[principles](../principles/) and a draft [strategy](../strategy/)

}

## New Pilot: Machine Learning Intelligibility (v0.25)

{ briefly explain how using this as a focal point}
