title: Don't Create a Solution, Grow an Ecosystem
---


- It's easy to get sucked in by vendors or evangelists who tell you that their tool, language, or platform will solve all your problems. But for most organizations, one size doesn't fit all.
- At the same time, you don't want to let users and then managers create a snarled rat's nest of solutions that's impossible to maintain. You need a balance of order and chaos -- in short, a thriving ecosystem
- Given how fast analytics/data science tools and users' expectations are changing, trying to plan it all out is a recipe for disaster. Instead of trying to create a single solution, think of it as growing an ecosystem that will evolve and adapt to new circumstances
