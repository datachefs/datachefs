For most people, using data feels intimidating and boring -- and working with data is often taught in a way that reinforces those feelings. 

What if we were to make working with data more like play? That would draw in more newcomers, make it less scary for them, and encourage them to want to learn more.

Obviously, you wouldn't want to use this approach all the time -- or even most of the time. The goal isn't that everything should feel like play, it's to find strategic points where we can use a sense of play or playfulness to help users get more comfortable using data to shape how the organization makes decisions.
