## Don't Create a Solution, Grow an Ecosystem

It's easy to get sucked in by vendors or evangelists who tell you that their tool, language, or platform will solve all your problems. But for most organizations, one size doesn't fit all.

At the same time, you don't want to let users and then managers create a snarled rat's nest of solutions that's impossible to maintain or support. You need find a balance between chaos and order.

Given how fast analytics/data science tools and users' expectations are changing, trying to plan it all out is a recipe for disaster. Instead of trying to create a single solution, incrementally, iteratively grow an ecosystem that will evolve and adapt to new circumstances.


## Adapt Agile Development Practices to Fit Power Users' Needs
- it may just be a team of 1 (hire unknown's?) (You may also be the product owner/co-owner
- At least rudimentary lifecycle management. Organizations need to develop standards, processes, templates, etc., as well as training and mentoring to nurture this capacity
- there's version control: how do I make sure that if I make mistakes I can roll it back?
- Standards that if one data scientists is out for a bit somebody else can step in -- e.g., even basic things like how your files organized

- figure out how to overcome resistance they'll inevitably encounter from many departments
- setting expectations so that citizen data scientists don't end up promising more than they can deliver -- and they have room to make mistakes while they are still learning without creating huge problems


## Grow An Agile Data Infrastructure
- Agile Data Governance
  - what you call things? What kind of assumptions did you make when you chose your data?
  - What date field did you choose for analyzing that sales data?
  - there's a bunch of bad data in here that I didn't realize that was there, because the reports I use have been designed to hide it or they don't show up because of the criteria that they are used
  - Enterprises can't have lots of successful power users without a solid data foundation -- and in the real world, that requires skilled data engineers.  But how do you do this without drowning in it?  If you don't have a strategy and set expectations
  - Agile Data Governance: Do it like scrum -- not everything, but backlog list
- How you pull the data





## Design in Diversity from the Ground Up




## Continuously Smooth the Learning Curve

Too often, the path tools put power users on is pretty raggedy.
- Some tools are great at letting you perform a handful of actions, but once you bump into needs that go beyond the simple things the tool can do, you fall off a cliff: you can't make any progress until a developer steps in.
- Other tools, such as pandas or R, give you a lot of room to grow as your needs become more complex, but getting started can be incredibly intimidating.
- And some tools, such as some of the new "Auto ML" tools that reduce the work needed for machine learning, are like microwaving a Hot Pocket. Most users have no idea about the assumptions and implicit decisions built into the tools are using -- and as these tools become critical to an organization's success, this is a recipe for disaster.

Data Chefs is based on the principle that we want it make it is easy for users to get started as possible, but we also want to make it easy to continue to learn and grow as a user's needs expand.

Makers All, the parent organization for Data Chefs, advocates for a strategy of [smoothing the learning curve](https://toolkit.makersall.org/pages/30-smooth/00-index.html) for all languages, frameworks, and tools for developing emerging tech. Makers All advocates for tech companies and techies who create languages, frameworks, tools, etc. to collaborate with community groups to improve coding UX. Data Chefs' argues that:
- Individual organizations should use a chopped down, lightweight version of Maker All's strategy that's designed to fit the needs of their organization and their staff -- e.g., for a particular set of needs, creating a simple, lightweight library that hides some of panda's complexity, plus template Jupyter notebooks and cheat sheets.
- As organizations begin to collaborate across ecosystems, start taking baby steps towards the more robust approach envisioned by Makers All


## Harness the Power of Community

When organizations training and support their power users, they typically focus primarily on individuals -- even if they are training staff by department. But organizations aren't just composed of individuals. Humans are social creatures who are often part of rich, complex networks. 

Makers All, the parent organization for Data Chefs, argues that our society would be far more effective in training community members to become emerging tech developers if we learn from the example of agricultural's Extension Services, which leveraged the social nature of people to radically transform agricultural practices. For example, Extension Services employed at least one Extension agents in every rural county, who would:

- __Identify and develop Natural Leaders__. Extension agents often focused on identifying and developing natural leaders: farmers who were already widely respected in their community.  These natural leaders had preexisting social networks and relationships they could use to recruit other famers.  And they were also likely to understand the concerns and fears that agents needed to address if farmers were to be convinced to adopt new techniques.  
- __Nurture Neighborhood Clubs__. Extension agents helped farming communities form neighborhood clubs and worked with clubs to ensure farmers got a steady stream of ideas about how they could improve their farming.  As a result, farmers weren't just hearing about an idea brought in by an outsider, they were learning while surrounded by their peers who spoke the same language and understood the realities they faced.  
- __Foster Community Events__. Extension agents helped foster state fairs and other places where farmers could see demonstrations, compete to see who could use new techniques to grow the best crops, etc.

Data Chefs' argues that:
- Individual organizations should use a chopped down, lightweight version of Maker All's strategy that's designed to fit the needs of their organization and their staff 
- As organizations begin to collaborate across ecosystems, start taking baby steps towards the more robust approach envisioned by Makers All


## Encourage Play

For most people, using data feels intimidating and boring -- and working with data is often taught that way. What if we were to make it feel more like play? That would draw in more newcomers, make data training and visualization less scary for them, and encourage them to want to learn more.

Making play a central feature of data means redesigning tools so that they offer not only a high level of rigor, but a heavy dose of fun as well.  It also means changing the way we think about data work and training.  Taking a cue from those on the vanguard of sports and pop culture analytics and visualization, we aim to foster a learning community that learns about data in ways that are interesting, dynamic, and playful.
