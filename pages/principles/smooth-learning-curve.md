title: Continuously Smooth the Learning Curve

Too often, the path tools put power users on is pretty raggedy:
- Some tools are great at letting you perform a handful of actions, but once you bump into needs that go beyond the simple things the tool can do, you fall off a cliff: you can't make any progress until a developer steps in.
- Other tools, such as pandas or R, give you a lot of room to grow as your needs become more complex, but getting started can be incredibly intimidating.
- And some tools, such as some of the new "Auto ML" tools that reduce the work needed for machine learning, are like microwaving a Hot Pocket. Most users have no idea about the assumptions and implicit decisions built into the tools are using -- and as these tools become critical to an organization's success, this is a recipe for disaster.

Data Chefs is based on the principle that we want it make it is easy for users to get started as possible, but we also want to make it easy to continue to learn and grow as a user's needs expand.

Makers All, the parent organization for Data Chefs, advocates for a strategy of [smoothing the learning curve](https://toolkit.makersall.org/pages/30-smooth/00-index.html) for all languages, frameworks, and tools for developing emerging tech. Makers All advocates for tech companies and techies who create languages, frameworks, tools, etc. to collaborate with community groups to improve coding UX. Data Chefs' argues that:
- Individual organizations should use a chopped down, lightweight version of Maker All's strategy that's designed to fit the needs of their organization and their staff -- e.g., for a particular set of needs, creating a simple, lightweight library that hides some of panda's complexity, plus template Jupyter notebooks and cheat sheets.
- As organizations begin to collaborate across ecosystems, start taking baby steps towards the more robust approach envisioned by Makers All
