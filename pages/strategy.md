_NOTE: currently, this strategy is just a very brief, MVPish sketch.  Before I start fleshing it out, I want to get more feedback on the [principles](principles/), since they'll have a big impact on the framework.  I also need to spend some time seeing if I can reorganize it areound the metaphor of an ecosystem._

## Implementing Data Chefs Inside Your Organization

### 1) Quick and Dirty Assessment
- what immediate problem
- what obstacles from past efforts
- HR issues
- Setting expectations

### 2) Get Your Feet Wet
- Pick one or two small, timeboxed pilot projects that will give you a chance to 
  - Win a small but strategic victory
  - Test out your assumptions
- Based on the organization's culture, pick an Agile methodology or methodologies to run the pilot(s)
- During the pilot(s), focus on producing useful MVPs and on continuous improvement
- At the end of the pilots, do a short assessment of what you've learned

### 3) Swim Out to Slightly Deeper Waters
- Pick 2-3 small, timeboxed pilot projects that will give you a chance to 
  - Win a small but strategic victory
  - Try out your current approach with 
    - At least one team that's likely to have a clear-cut win 
    - One team that has more complex needs, to start pressure testing your assumptions and approach
- During the pilot(s), focus on producing useful MVPs and on continuous improvement
- At the end of the pilots, do a short assessment of what you've learned
- Either during or after the pilots, start building stronger senior management support

#### 4) Take a Deeper Dive
- Step back and ask:
  - Do we have a sense of what development practices and infrastructure we're going to need?  
  - Are we ready to start building a community inside the organization -- and/or, if other organizations we know have implemented Data Chefs, build our community and connect it to the wider Data Chefs community?
  - Do we think we've got a good beginning handle on the risks we need to manage?
    - Do we think we've learned enough to develop a simple roadmap and start building the internal coalition we need to thrive?
- If you're ready to develop a short, simple roadmap, go for it!  If not, do another round of #3
