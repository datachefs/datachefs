The more important data is to our economy, the more critical it is for a broad range of people to be able to slice, dice, and explain it. Data Chefs is a framework for helping democratize working with data by:

 - Creating a [Community-Oriented, Inclusive Ecosystem](/pages/strategies/community2.html)
 - Encouraging [Playfulness and Creativity](/pages/strategies/play2.html)

These 2 strategies are shaped by the principle of [Smoothing the Learning Curve](/pages/strategies/smooth-learning-curve2.html)


Data Chefs is focused on addressing one of todayâ€™s most pressing tech needs. But in doing so, it also hopes to develop a model for helping communities [shape and benefit from the explosion of wealth](https://toolkit.makersall.org/) that will be created by AI/ML, VR/AR, and other emerging tech over the next 20-30 years.

_NOTE: Data Chefs is a work in progress. This is v.0.5_

{NOTE: need to figure out how to
