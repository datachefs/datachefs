{ Pieces of the Puzzle:

## Changing the Tools

The goal: to improve the Learnability and UX of the tools we use, not only for beginners but for each step along the continuum from beginners to power users to "blue-collar coders" to analytics engineers and data scientists.

Tool makers: improve the overall UX of their tool

Organizations, and communities of organizations: build scaffolding (?) around tools to make them easier to use. Example:
 - Instead of trying to improve the overall UX of the pandas data science library, an organization might create a simple, lightweight library on top of pandas that makes it much easier to use pandas to address a few specific user or department needs, plus some template Jupyter notebooks and cheat sheets that target those needs.

Tool makers, organizations, communities of organizations: create:
 - Curated Code recipes
   - Tool makers: consider modifying IDE's/tools so easy to navigate "cookbooks"
 - Better documentation, cheat sheets, etc., organized to make it easier to understand how you move up the learning curve

## Soft Skills (need better name)
- Helping an Organization Become More Data-Driven
- Improving the UX of Data
- Making Trade-Offs / Being Pragmatic
- Data Cleanup Vs Analysis
- Developer's Tools: Version Control, Etc.

## Bigger Steps
- Coding UX Research
- You Don't Need to Be a Chemist To Bake Good Cookies: focusing more on what mental models people need to develop as they work their way up the learning curve
- Why do __I__need to build a model of Shopify?  Figuring out better ways of sharing higher level / more abstracted work
- Data Modeling ala Jarvis (tool building scene in first Ironman)
 - Recipes and Visual -- why should I have to remember crap? (Instead of constantly Googling)

## Not Sure Where to Put
- The problem of self-selection bias 
   - "Posttraumatic Locker Syndrome"
- Everyone a tool maker -- e.g., encouraging people to create views earlier as well as becoming a more sophisticated consumer of views
- Smoothing the learning curve helps folks one step above -- e.g., data scientists are now more likely to produce useful products


NOTE: the idea of Smoothing the Learning Curve comes from [research](https://toolkit.makersall.org/pages/30-smooth/00-index.html) by Makers All, the parent organization for Data Chefs
