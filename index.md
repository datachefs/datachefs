Over the past decade, the tools for helping staff who aren't coders or data scientists transform and analyze data have gotten more and more powerful. Even in machine learning/AI, we're in the early stages of "Auto ML" that lets power users do some of the work of data scientists.  

But in the rush to build better tools, no one's addressing a major challenge: how can large organizations unleash this powerful tech without creating a hot mess? Because these tools aren't magic:

- __Easy to Use Doesn't Mean Easy to Master__.  Just because tools let users do more doesn't mean it's easy for users to use them effectively. For example, when power users reach the point where they need to go beyond what's simple to do with a tool, they'll need guidance if they aren't going to end up squandering huge amounts of time. This is especially true because unlike data scientists and database developers, many power users won't be using their skills every day or even every week
- __Power Tools + No Discipline = A Hot Mess__.  As power users take on more responsibility for data work, they'll also need to develop more data discipline, such as at least rudimentary lifecycle management. Organizations need to develop standards, processes, templates, etc., as well as training and mentoring to nurture this capacity -- and figure out how to overcome resistance they'll inevitably encounter from many departments.

Based on my decades of field experience and my research at [Makers All](https://makersall.org/), I'm developing a solution I call Data Chefs. It's a framework for 

- Growing an organization's internal ecosystem that helps power users flourish, using an iterative approach that racks up small, strategic wins while building towards larger victories
- Building an ecosystem across organizations so they can pool resources
- Using ecosystem to connect large organizations with the community, so communities can also benefit -- and in doing so, laying the groundwork to help communities from Harlem to Harlan County benefit from the explosion of wealth that will be created by emerging tech over the next 20 years
