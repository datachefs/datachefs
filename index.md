The more important data is to our economy, the more critical it is for a broad range of people to be able to slice, dice, and explain it. So, many are trying to democratize working with data.

Most attempts fall into one of two camps:

1) __Microwaving a bag of popcorn__. Just point and click, and you can bang out a remarkably sophisticated analysis. But you don't understand what's going on. Your choices are limited to the products vendors create. And you can't experiment much.

2) __Butchering a Pig__.  Some coding tools and frameworks give their users a remarkable amount of power over how they manipulate data. But these tools are intimidating as hell to most people.

What if we made learning to work with data more like learning to bake cupcakes?

It's pretty easy to learn how to make cupcakes.  But the tools and knowledge you pick up allow you to cook a much wider range of food. And unlike learning to microwave popcorn, learning how to bake cupcakes can put you on the path to becoming a good home cook or even a professional chef.

Data Chefs is a framework for helping democratize working with data by:
 - Helping organizations and tool makers smooth the learning curve from beginner to power user to analytics engineer or data scientist
 - Laying a foundation to make well paid data work more accessible to communities from Harlem to Harlan County

To do so, it uses  3 strategies:

 - [Smooth the Learning Curve](/pages/strategies/smooth-learning-curve.html)
 - Use a [Community-Oriented, Inclusive Approach](/pages/strategies/community.html)
 - Encourage [Playfulness and Creativity](/pages/strategies/play.html)

Data Chefs is focused on addressing one of todayâ€™s most pressing tech needs. But in doing so, it also hopes to develop a model for helping communities [shape and benefit from the explosion of wealth](https://toolkit.makersall.org/) that will be created by AI/ML, VR/AR, and other emerging tech over the next 20-30 years.

_NOTE: Data Chefs is a work in progress. This is v.0.4_
