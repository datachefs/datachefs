Datachefs is a [Makers All](https://makersall.org/) initiative to explore making working with data more accessible to communities from Harlem to Harlan County and to users in corporations, nonprofits, and other organizations who aren't coders -- and in doing so, help to diversify the tech industry.

NOTE: this site is still under construction and isn't ready for prime time.
