The more important data is to our economy, the more we need people who can slice, dice, and explain it. So, many are trying to democratize working with data.

Most attempts fall into one of two camps:

1) __Microwaving a bag of popcorn__. Just point and click, and you can bang out a remarkably sophisticated analysis. But you don't understand what's going on. Your choices are limited to the products vendors create. And you can't experiment much.

2) __Butchering a Pig__.  There are tools where being able to write complex scripts can give users an incredible amount of power. But these tools are intimidating as hell to most people.

What if we made learning to working with data more like learning to bake cupcakes?

It's pretty easy to learn how to make cupcakes, but the tools and knowledge you pick up give you a much wider range of food you could cook. And unlike learning to microwave popcorn, learning how to bake cupcakes can put you on the path to becoming a good home cook or even a professional chef.

Data Chefs is a project to help democratize working with data by:
 - Helping [organizations](/organizations/) and [tool makers](/toolmakers/) smooth the learning curve from beginner to power user to analytics engineer or data scientist
 - Laying the foundations to make well paid data work more accessible to communities from Harlem to Harlan County

In doing so, Data Chefs hopes to develop a model for helping communities [shape and benefit from the explosion of wealth](https://toolkit.makersall.org/) that will be created by AI/ML, VR/AR, and other emerging tech over the next 20-30 years.

_NOTE: Data Chefs is a work in progress. This is v.0.25_
