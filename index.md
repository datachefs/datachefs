These days, our world is awash in data.  Knowing how to slice and dice it can unlock powerful insights, and being skilled at it can help you get a better job. So a lot of folks are trying to democratize working with data.

Most attempts to democratize data fall into one of two camps:

1) __Microwaving a bag of popcorn__. Just point and click, and you can bang out a remarkably sophisticated analysis. But you don't understand what's going on. Your choices are limited to the products manufacturers make. And you can't experiment much.

2) __Butchering a Pig__.  There are tools where being able to write complex scripts can give users an incredible amount of power. But these tools are intimidating as hell to most people.

What if we made working with data more like making chocolate chip cookies or baking cupcakes?

Baking cookies is easy, too, but the tools and knowledge you pick up give you a much wider range of food to cook. And unlike learning to microwave popcorn, learning how to bake cookies can put you on the path to becoming a good home cook or even a professional chef.


That's the goal of Data Chefs -- to help find ways of making working with data more accessible to a much wider audience and to [smooth the learning curve](https://toolkit.makersall.org/pages/30-smooth/00-index.html) from nervous newbie to power user to blue collar coder to data scientist.

_NOTE: Data Chefs is a work in progress. This is v.0.25_
