The more important data is to our economy, the more critical it is for people in every community to be able to slice, dice, and explain it. So, many are trying to democratize working with data.

Most attempts fall into one of two camps:

1) __Microwaving a bag of popcorn__. Just point and click, and you can bang out a remarkably sophisticated analysis. But you don't understand what's going on. Your choices are limited to the products vendors create. And you can't experiment much.

2) __Butchering a Pig__.  Some coding tools and frameworks give their users a remarkable amount of power over how they can manipulate data. But most people find these tools intimidating as hell.

What if we made learning to work with data more like learning to bake cupcakes?

It's pretty easy to learn how to make cupcakes.  But the tools and knowledge you pick up allow you to cook a much wider range of food. And unlike learning to microwave popcorn, learning how to bake cupcakes can put you on the path to becoming a good home cook or even a professional chef.

Data Chefs is a framework for helping democratize working with data by:

 - Creating a [Community-Oriented, Inclusive Ecosystem](/pages/strategies/community.html)
 - Encouraging [Playfulness and Creativity](/pages/strategies/play.html)

These 2 strategies are shaped by the principle of [Smoothing the Learning Curve](/pages/strategies/smooth-learning-curve.html)

Data Chefs is focused on addressing one of our societyâ€™s current technology needs. But in doing so, it also hopes to develop a model for helping communities [shape and benefit from the explosion of wealth](https://toolkit.makersall.org/) that will be created by AI/ML, VR/AR, and other emerging tech over the next 20-30 years.

_NOTE: Data Chefs is a work in progress. This is v.0.5_
