The more important data is to our economy, the more critical it is for people in every community to be able to slice, dice, and explain it.

Data Chefs is a grassroots-oriented framework for democratizing working with data by:

 - Creating a [Community-Oriented, Inclusive Ecosystem](/pages/strategies/community.html)
 - Encouraging [Playfulness and Creativity](/pages/strategies/play.html)

These 2 strategies are shaped by the principle of [Smoothing the Learning Curve](/pages/strategies/smooth-learning-curve.html)

Data Chefs is focused on addressing one of our societyâ€™s current technology needs. But in doing so, it also hopes to develop a model and the beginnings of a community infrastructure for helping communities [shape and benefit from the explosion of wealth](https://toolkit.makersall.org/) that will be created by AI/ML, VR/AR, and other emerging tech over the next 20-30 years.

_NOTE: Data Chefs is a work in progress. This is v.0.55_
