_NOTE: Data Chefs is a work in progress. This is v.0.25_

Over the past decade, the tools that let staff who arenâ€™t coders transform and analyze data have gotten more and more powerful. But if an organization just rolls out these tools to lots of power users without having a broader strategy about how the pieces will fit together, they're likely to create a hot mess.

Based on [research at Makers All](https://toolkit.makersall.org) and decades of field experience, we're developing a solution called Data Chefs. Data Chefs is a framework to help organizations unleash the power of analytics and data science by growing organizational ecosystems of power users / "[citizen data scientists](https://blogs.gartner.com/carlie-idoine/2018/05/13/citizen-data-scientists-and-why-they-matter/)" -- and to do so in a way that in the long term will also help the community. It advocates for:

- Growing an organization's internal ecosystem to help power users flourish, using an iterative approach that racks up small, strategic wins while building towards larger victories
- Building an ecosystem across organizations so they can share knowledge, pool resources, and collectively work to [smooth the learning curve](https://toolkit.makersall.org/pages/30-smooth/00-index.html) from beginner to power user to data scientist/engineer
- Using this ecosystem across organizations to connect large organizations to the community, so communities can also benefit -- and in doing so, laying the groundwork to help communities from Harlem to Harlan County [benefit from the explosion of wealth](https://toolkit.makersall.org) that will be created by emerging tech over the next 20 years.
